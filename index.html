            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal academic website, where I showcase my research, projects, and journey in astronomy and beyond. My passion lies in exploring the universe, both scientifically and through personal adventures.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Sean Heakes, an aspiring astronomer and researcher currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Astronomy. My academic path has been anything but traditional—I’ve spent years traveling the world, working odd jobs, and tree planting to support my studies. These experiences have shaped my approach to research, blending hands-on problem-solving with rigorous scientific inquiry.</p>
            <p>My interests lie in atmospheric modeling, spectral line absorption, and radio astronomy. Currently, I'm involved in research at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory, where I work on spectral data processing and drone photogrammetry operations. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a deep fascination with engineering, programming, and practical machine work.</p>
